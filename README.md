# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Opponent

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game with a built-in AI opponent. Challenge yourself against an intelligent AI that uses strategic decision-making to try and outsmart you. You can also race against the clock to test how quickly you can make your moves!

- **Timer Mode:** Choose to play against the timer for added challenge.

## How the AI Works

The AI utilizes a strategy to evaluate potential moves and choose the optimal one, aiming to win or block the player where necessary. The AI's decisions are based on the following:

1. Aim to win: If the AI can win in the next move, it will do so.
2. Block the opponent: If the player is a move away from winning, the AI will block them.
3. Strategic play: The AI will choose the next best move if the previous options are unavailable.
